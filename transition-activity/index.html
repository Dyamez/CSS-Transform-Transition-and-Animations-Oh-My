          <p id="textContent">
            Located in a quiet valley of Columbia County, Pennsylvania, is one of the state’s least likely and least publicized tourist
            attractions: Centralia. What draws people to this out-of-the-way town isn’t the amazing culture or the fascinating 
            historical sites.<br>
            Instead, it’s the lack of things to see. You see, Centralia is a modern ghost town in PA. So, what’s the history of the 
            town and what is there to do when visiting Centralia, PA? Keep reading to find out.<br>
            In the early sixties, the borough of Centralia was just like any number of coal region towns in Pennsylvania.<br> The community
            of roughly 1,500 was supported by the seam of coal that ran beneath the town. However, in 1962, a fire was lit in the town 
            dump that spread beneath the entire valley and threatened the community’s existence.</p>
